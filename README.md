# Aadhaarical
Aadhaarical - Get your Driving Licence only associated with aadhaar. Project for Aadhaar Hackathon organised by HackerEarth.

[+] Aadhaar Hackathon organised by Angelprime, Smart Chip, khosla labs and NASSCOM and handled by HackerEarth.

Why to go to RT and stand in long queues to get your document verification for driving licence when you get it online via Aadhaarical. Problem of a normal person - standing in queue, touts asking for extra money and date skip for driving test. Hence we tried to figure out the natural problem and came up with Aadhaarical that would take just your aadhaar number and associated mobile number would get otp and after otp verification, details of aadhaar holder would be reflected and it will ask to apply for DL.

Seperate form of each DL application, let it be LMV or anyother, based on RTO of that city, application would be submitted to respective RTO office and it will led you to Online Test Screen, that would be having easy traffic question and timer would be running for 5 min to give exam. As per the qualification of exam, respective date would be assiged for Driving Test.

AngelPrime, a seed-stage Venture Capital Fund based in Bangalore and NASSCOM, in collaboration with UIDAI, brings you "Aadhaar Application Hackathon".

The aim of the Aadhaar hackathon is to encourage and promote the development of applications that utilize the open Aadhaar APIs. The event allowed us to indulge in a non-stop 2 day coding marathon. We were invited to participate in the hackathon on the weekend of 6th -7th June 2015 to build products under any of the following categories:

[+] Payments - Can you think of an Aadhaar based solution to make paying local vendors easy and paperless.

[+] Government Benefits - How can you Aadhaar to make claiming and allotting government benefits easier? Think of using internet enabled services that will help you do this.

[+] Healthcare - Access health records of people across multiple hospitals using one Aadhaar number? Make government hospitals smarter using Aadhaar? It's your choice.

[+] Online to Offline - Not all of India is online. How can Aadhaar leverage the power of online and deliver it offline? Think and build

[+] Open Category - Think of any other way you think Aadhaar can impact our day to day life and make our every day transactions more convenient.

[+] FMCG - Think of Aadhaar to make manufacturers and merchant interactions simpler. Or an Aadhaar based inventory management tool.

[+] Financial Services - Centralise banking using Aadhaar number. Or make banking authentication seamless and simple
